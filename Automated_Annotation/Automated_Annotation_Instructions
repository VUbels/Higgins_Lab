For first time users, the annotation pipeline aims to provide a largely autonamous experience with only sparse user input.
Start by opening the Parameter_File.R, this can be done in a dedicated environment or simply in notepad.
Each of script SkinHF_01 to SkinHF_05 requires parameters handled in the parameter file.
Parameters are determined by the user based on the output of the previous script.

In Parameter_File.R first enter the Global Parameters and parameters for Script_01.
Each parameter is explained within the file and should present no difficulty.
